- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I initially thought that Encapsulation was really helpful enough to store information and makes the program run efficiently without having to show other classes the attributes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 What did not work in the first place was having to construct the cars of the train until I managed to get TA hours to fix the problem and revise my code. The go() function worked in the Engine class. I thought I did something wrong in not getting the fuel capacity and printing information of the Train and its features like fuel capacity, but it turned out I neede to use System.out.println() with the statements to make sure the code function. I would advise someone that when a feature is not printed, use System.out.println() and to not be afraid of trying the problems by themselves before getting help.
